# Searchfacile
Project for Analysis of Web Information course. 

Created a search engine based on data mining on the web (searching names of lawyers).

ProgettoBingSearch folder contains all the functions that allows to download webpages from the web.
ProgettoHtmlIndexer folder contains an html cleaner and functions to upload all the webpages downloaded in an elasticsearch istance.
